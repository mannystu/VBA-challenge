#Stuart Manito Smith’s VBA-challenge

##Purpose

In order to track my progress to becoming a programmer and Excel master! I used VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data.

## What I did

I created a script that looped through all the stocks for one year and output the following information:

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

  *I also created conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red. I made sure to use a pastel because solid red and green in excel look butt awful.

*In addition, I created a summary table listed the stock with 
the "Greatest % increase", 
"Greatest % decrease" 
and "Greatest total volume".

*I also programing some additional formatting to make the numbers output as “0.00%” and autofit the columns so it would look too trashy.
